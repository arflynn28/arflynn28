# 🛰️ Hey, I’m @arflynn28!
I work on geospatial ML, remote sensing, and GIS development. I also have a totally unnecessary but fun idea: rocket-based LiDAR for high-speed terrain mapping. Let’s see where that goes.

🌱 What I’m Learning
- 🐍 Python – Pretty solid, using it for geospatial & remote sensing work.

- 📌 JavaScript – Still taming the beast (especially for GIS apps).

- 🤖 TensorFlow – Slowly but surely making sense of neural networks for remote sensing.

🌍 What I’m Into

- AI for geospatial analysis – because maps should be smart.

- Remote sensing & GIS development – turning data into insights.

- Rocket-based LiDAR? A ridiculous idea, but I kinda want to make it happen. 🚀

🤝 Looking to Collaborate On

- Open-source GIS & remote sensing tools.

- AI/ML projects for environmental or spatial analysis.

- Anything involving satellites, big geospatial data, or crazy ideas.
