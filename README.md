# 🛰️ Hey, I’m @arflynn28!
I work on geospatial ML, remote sensing, and GIS development.

🌱 What I’m Learning
- 🐍 Python – Pretty solid, using it for geospatial & remote sensing work.

- 📌 JavaScript – Still taming the beast (especially for GIS applications).

- 🤖 TensorFlow – Slowly but surely making sense of neural networks for remote sensing.

- 🖥️ BlenderGIS – Playing around with terrain modeling, visualization, and LiDAR point cloud modelling.

🌍 What I’m Into

- AI for geospatial analysis – because maps should be smart.

- Remote sensing & GIS development – turning data into insights.

- Exploring ways to inspire and educate young people about Earth Observation and geospatial tech.
