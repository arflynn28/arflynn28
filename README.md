# Hey, I’m @arflynn28!
I work on geospatial ML, remote sensing, and GIS development.

What I’m Learning
- Python – Pretty solid, using it for geospatial & remote sensing work.

- JavaScript – Still expanding my understanding (especially for GIS applications).

- TensorFlow – Slowly but surely making sense.

- BlenderGIS – Playing around with terrain modeling, visualization, and LiDAR point cloud modelling.

What I’m Into

- AI for geospatial analysis

- Remote sensing & GIS development

- Exploring ways to inspire and educate young people about Earth Observation and geospatial tech.

Projects I’m Working On

- **Earth Observation Soundscapes** – Turning satellite data into music by mapping geospatial variables to pitch, rhythm, and instruments. (In Progress)
